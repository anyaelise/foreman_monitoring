# foreman_monitoring

Monitoring is listed as one of the features for Foreman, but the reality is that in the base installation there is currently very little monitoring done. foreman_monitoring is a plugin that aims to fill the current gaps in the monitoring capabilities of Foreman by building on Nagios. The results will be made available by adding a health checks layer to the hosts view.
